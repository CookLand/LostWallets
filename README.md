## The advantage of collective search:
You will not go through combinations that have already been completed.</br>
Many lone hunters very often make mistakes.</br>
The server controls all ranges and issues new ones.</br>
You do not need to select the correct masks, hashes and more.</br>
If the password is found, all participants will win and receive coins.

## The terms of participation:
25% - Received by the partner (whose hash is in the table)</br>
 5% - Organizers</br>
70% - is divided among all participants in % of ranges covered.</br>

For example, you searched for 3 days and stopped.</br>
The password was picked up in 3-6 months from a wallet of 500 BTC.</br>
The sum of 70% of the find of 350 BTC is divided by the number of combinations passed.</br>
You will be paid % for your completed segment.</br>
The more combinations you have completed, the higher your %</br>
Make sure your address is in the [**table**](https://github.com/phrutis/LostWallets/blob/main/Others/Table.md).</br>
In a collective search, everyone wins.</br>
Enough coins for everyone

99% - YES</br>
Wallets were maximally checked for validity.</br>

Jacks were presented to me by various hunters for 25% of the amount of the find.</br>

After verification, it will be added to the table with your btc address.</br>
If hunters find password you will get 25%<hr>
