## The advantage of collective search:
You will not go through combinations that have already been completed.</br>
Many lone hunters very often make mistakes.</br>
The server controls all ranges and issues new ones.</br>
You do not need to select the correct masks, hashes and more.</br>
If the password is found, all participants will win and receive coins.

## The terms of participation:
25% - Received by the partner (whose hash is in the table)</br>
 5% - Organizers</br>
70% - is divided among all participants in % of ranges covered.</br>

For example, you searched for 3 days and stopped.</br>
The password was picked up in 3-6 months from a wallet of 500 BTC.</br>
The sum of 70% of the find of 350 BTC is divided by the number of combinations passed.</br>
You will be paid % for your completed segment.</br>
The more combinations you have completed, the higher your %</br>
Make sure your address is in the [**table**](https://github.com/phrutis/LostWallets/blob/main/Others/Table.md).</br>
In a collective search, everyone wins.</br>
Enough coins for everyone

## Frequently asked Questions

**I am a miner and I want to search anonymously!**

Connect your rigs to the server.</br>
Write in telegram ```phrutis``` your empty BTC address and the numbers of your agents on the list.</br>
An anonymous nickname will be created with your BTC addresses.</br>
If the password is found, your % will be paid to your address<hr>

**What guarantees that I will be paid when the password is found?**

If you need guarantees look for yourself [**here**](https://github.com/phrutis/LostWallets/blob/main/Others/alonene.md), you will find 50% of yours guaranteed.</br>
In a collective search, there is no way to guarantee that the participants are trustworthy.</br>
If you know a way to guarantee it, let the group know about it and we'll discuss it.</br>
I understand and appreciate the hunters who invest their money and GPU resources for our common victory.</br>
In a collective search, it makes no logical sense to deceive the hunters.</br>
There are many wallets, large sums, enough coins for everyone.<hr>

**Are your wallets real?**</br>

99% - YES</br>
Wallets were maximally checked for validity.</br>
Coins were sent to some dubious wallets for verification.</br>
There is no way to verify wallet.dat is 100%</br>
This can only be done if the correct password is entered.<hr>

**How do you have so many wallets?**</br>

Jacks were presented to me by various hunters for 25% of the amount of the find.</br>
Hunters received wallet.dat by exchanging with other hunters.<hr>

**I have an old wallet.dat (not from a table) want 25%**</br>

You can contact me in telegram ```phrutis```</br>
Provide me with the old wallet.dat</br>
After verification, it will be added to the table with your btc address.</br>
If hunters find password you will get 25%<hr>

**I have a wallet.dat with the same hex, there is a different amount, it's empty, it's a fake?**</br>

You may have an older version of wallet.dat</br>
There is a newer one in the challenge.</br>
In a later version, the user could add a new address and receive coins on it.</br>
The old version of wallet.dat does not have this address.</br>
Or vice versa.<hr>


**Sell me all your wallets**</br>

I don't sell or buy wallet.dat</br>
And I do not advise you to buy.
